# Learning ASP.NET Core - WebAPI (.NET 7) Documenting Using Swagger

This repository contains examples showing how to documenting an API (WebAPI 7) using Swagger.

Based on this course [Documenting an ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Using Swagger](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-web-api-documenting-swagger/table-of-contents).

Original course materials can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-web-api-documenting-swagger/exercise-files) and [here](https://github.com/KevinDockx/DocumentingAspNetCore6API).

## Setup

To run API:

```cmd
cd .\contacts\backend\api
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet build
dotnet watch run
cd ..
```

To update NuGet packages consider using [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) [:file_folder:](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket).

```cmd
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install paket
dotnet tool restore
dotnet paket init
dotnet tool restore
dotnet paket restore
dotnet paket install
dotnet paket outdated
dotnet paket update
```

You might use Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider to update NuGet packages (it will be a lot simpler :-)).
